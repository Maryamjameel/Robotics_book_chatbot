## Prompt

(User triggered `/sp.plan` command with no additional arguments)

## Response snapshot

Created comprehensive implementation plan for Docusaurus project initialization with architecture decisions, research findings, and detailed setup instructions.

**Key deliverables**:

1. **Implementation Plan** (`plan.md` - 431 lines):
   - Complete technical context and constitution compliance check
   - Detailed project structure for frontend (web application)
   - Configuration schemas for `docusaurus.config.ts` and `sidebars.ts`
   - File-by-file implementation mapping
   - 7 high-level implementation steps with acceptance criteria
   - Edge case handling strategies
   - Success metrics mapped to spec requirements

2. **Research Document** (`research.md` - 412 lines):
   - In-depth analysis of Docusaurus 3.x best practices
   - Tailwind CSS v4 vs v3 comparison (selected v3 stable)
   - GitHub Pages deployment strategies (selected GitHub Actions)
   - Content organization patterns for 20-30 chapters and 200+ glossary terms
   - TypeScript strict mode compatibility investigation
   - Alternatives considered with detailed rationale

3. **Quickstart Guide** (`quickstart.md` - 584 lines):
   - Step-by-step setup instructions (10 detailed steps)
   - Prerequisites verification commands
   - Configuration file examples with annotations
   - Success verification checklist
   - Common issues and solutions
   - GitHub Actions workflow configuration

**Architecture decisions**:

- **Technology Stack**:
  - Docusaurus 3.x (latest) - Modern React SSG with excellent TypeScript support
  - TypeScript 5.x with strict mode - Type safety and constitution compliance
  - Tailwind CSS v3 (stable) - Deferred v4 beta until stable release
  - GitHub Actions - Automated CI/CD deployment

- **Content Organization**:
  - Flat chapter structure with manual sidebar configuration (explicit educational ordering)
  - One file per glossary term with autogenerated sidebar (scales to 200+ terms)
  - `docs/chapters/` for chapter content
  - `docs/glossary/` for glossary entries

- **Deployment Strategy**:
  - GitHub Actions automated deployment to gh-pages branch
  - Manual deployment for initial testing
  - Build artifacts not committed to main branch (clean git history)

**Constitution compliance**:
- ✅ Production-Grade Quality: TypeScript strict mode, error handling for build process
- ✅ Modular Architecture: Docusaurus standalone, backend services in future phases
- ✅ Content Quality & Accessibility: WCAG 2.1 AA compliant theme, responsive design
- ✅ Spec-Driven Development: Spec → Plan → Tasks workflow followed
- ✅ Technology Standards: Docusaurus 3.x, TypeScript strict, Tailwind CSS per constitution

**No violations identified** - All applicable constitution principles satisfied for initialization phase.

## Outcome

- ✅ Impact: Comprehensive architectural plan for robotics textbook platform foundation, with clear technology choices, deployment strategy, and implementation roadmap
- 🧪 Tests: Constitution Check validation passed (all gates green), research validated all unknowns resolved
- 📁 Files: Generated plan.md (431 lines), research.md (412 lines), quickstart.md (584 lines)
- 🔁 Next prompts: Run `/sp.tasks` to generate task breakdown in tasks.md, then execute implementation following quickstart guide
- 🧠 Reflection: This initialization task is foundation for entire textbook platform. Clear research and detailed quickstart will enable smooth implementation. Deferred Tailwind v4 until stable release reduces risk. Manual sidebar for chapters gives explicit control over educational progression.

## Evaluation notes (flywheel)

- Failure modes observed: None. Research phase successfully resolved all technical unknowns (Tailwind version, sidebar config, content organization).
- Graders run and results (PASS/FAIL): Constitution Check - PASS (no violations), Research completeness - PASS (all unknowns resolved), Quickstart usability - PASS (10 detailed steps with verification)
- Prompt variant (if applicable): Standard /sp.plan workflow with Phase 0 (research) and Phase 1 (design/quickstart)
- Next experiment (smallest change to try): Execute `/sp.tasks` to generate granular task breakdown, then follow quickstart guide to validate all steps work as documented
