An actuator is a component of a machine that is responsible for moving and controlling a mechanism or system. In robotics, motors are the most common type of actuators, converting electrical energy into mechanical motion (typically rotation or linear displacement) to drive the robot's joints. They are fundamental for generating the forces and torques required for robot movement. Various types exist, including DC motors, servo motors, stepper motors, and pneumatic or hydraulic actuators, each chosen based on power, precision, and speed requirements.

### Key Concepts
- **Energy Conversion**: Transforming electrical energy into mechanical work.
- **Joint Drive**: Providing motion and force to robot joints.
- **Force/Torque Generation**: Producing the necessary mechanical output.
- **Types**: DC, Servo, Stepper, Pneumatic, Hydraulic.
