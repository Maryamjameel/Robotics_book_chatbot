An Application Programming Interface (API) is a set of defined rules, routines, and protocols for building software applications. In robotics, APIs allow different software components or external applications to interact with a robot's functionalities in a standardized way. For example, a robot's control system might expose an API that allows developers to send commands for movement, retrieve sensor data, or manage high-level tasks without needing to understand the underlying complex internal mechanisms. APIs are crucial for modularity, extensibility, and interoperability in robotic software development.

### Key Concepts
- **Standardized Interaction**: Provides a consistent way to access functionalities.
- **Modularity**: Enables independent development and integration of components.
- **Abstraction**: Hides complex implementation details from users.
- **Protocols**: Defines how data is exchanged and requests are made.
