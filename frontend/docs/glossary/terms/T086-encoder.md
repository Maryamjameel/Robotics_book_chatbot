An encoder is a sensor used in robotics to provide feedback on the position, velocity, or rotational speed of a motor shaft or a joint. Most commonly, they are rotary encoders that convert angular position into an electrical signal, either digital or analog. This feedback is crucial for closed-loop control systems, allowing the robot's controller to know the precise state of its joints and make necessary adjustments to achieve desired motions. Encoders can be absolute, providing a unique position for each angle, or incremental, providing pulses that indicate changes in position.

### Key Concepts
- **Position Feedback**: Provides real-time data on joint angles or motor positions.
- **Closed-Loop Control**: Essential for precise control by comparing desired vs. actual states.
- **Rotary Encoder**: Converts angular motion into electrical signals.
- **Absolute/Incremental**: Different methods of position measurement.
